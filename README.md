A Summer Internship Project under PHYTEC India.

## Description
The Access Control project ensures *secure* and *reliable* *access management* to controlled areas. It utilizes **RFID Card** credentials for granting ordenying access and offers features like time tracking and remote administration.

Hardware components include a **Rugged Board-A5D2x**, **RFID reader module**, and **RTC module** for accurate timekeeping. **I2C** and **UART** protocols enable seamless communication. A user-friendly webinterface is created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, allowing administrators to efficiently manage access settings and user information. Alocally hosted **Python Server** handles data storage and access control logic.

**Multithreading** and the **MRAA** embedded library optimize performance. Linux is chosen for stability and security. Overall, the Access Control project provides a scalable solution for *secure access management*, combining hardware componentsand software technologies effectively.
